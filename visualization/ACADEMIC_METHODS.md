# Visualization Academic Methods

## Purpose
The visualization module translates normalized gear system coordinates into 2D graphical representations for analysis and verification. This serves as a critical validation step in the gear system design pipeline.

## Normalized Coordinate System
- All coordinates are normalized to a [-50, 50] range in both x and y dimensions
- This normalization ensures consistent scaling across different input configurations
- The normalization process preserves geometric relationships while removing scale dependencies

## Visualization Methodology
1. **Boundary Representation**:
   - The system boundary is drawn as a closed polygon
   - Uses matplotlib's Polygon patch for accurate rendering
   - Line width and color chosen for clear visibility

2. **Shaft Markers**:
   - Input shaft shown as red circle
   - Output shaft shown as blue circle
   - Color coding provides immediate visual identification

3. **Plot Configuration**:
   - Fixed axis limits [-50, 50] match normalized coordinate range
   - Equal aspect ratio ensures geometric accuracy (circles appear circular)
   - Grid lines provide spatial reference
   - Legend identifies key components

## Technical Considerations
- **Aspect Ratio**: Maintained at 1:1 to prevent distortion
- **Resolution**: Output at 300 DPI for high-quality images
- **File Format**: PNG chosen for lossless compression
- **Performance**: Minimal memory usage through immediate plot closure

## Validation Approach
The visualization serves as a sanity check that:
1. All components fit within the normalized boundaries
2. Spatial relationships match expectations
3. No obvious geometric anomalies are present
